    <h2>A Note from the Developer on Permissions</h2>
    In order to get the transport message headers I have to use the EWS makeEwsRequestAsync method, which requires the ReadWriteMailbox permission level. See the article
    <a href="https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/outlook/understanding-outlook-add-in-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Outlook add-in permissions</a>
    for more on this. If I could request fewer permissions I would, since I only ever read the one property, but I have no choice in the matter.<br />
    <br />
    When REST is more widely available, and a few REST specific bugs are fixed, I'll be able to switch to REST and request a lower permission level.<br />
